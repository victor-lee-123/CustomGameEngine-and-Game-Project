# CustomGameEngine-and-Game-Project
Custom Game Engine Project created with a group of developers and UI/UX engineers.
===================================

# Unnamed Engine created by UnnamedStudio
Unnamed Studio Engine is an engine specialized to various games, with an approach to scalability via utilizing ECS and components and thus allowing a modular and flexible developmental scaling. 
The studio comprises of a eight Year 2 computer science and UI/UX students from Singapore Institure of Technology.

The engine is programmed in C++ and uses OpenGL and GLSL as our graphics API. This programming language allows the team to focus on best practices and apply object-oriented programming design in our system structure. Our goal when coding the engine editor/game is to aim to implement a modular scalable system that allows the general development of games, in that of applying reusability through a Component/System-based system design with ECS.

Engine features:
- creating of entities
- serialization
- save/load/open files
- assets manager
- properties page (translation, rotation, scaling, textures, text colors, fonts etc.)
- drag-and-drop items
- real time gameplay in viewport
- on-screen entity transformation

# TO RUN THE ENGINE
Simply unzip the file, and run x64/Release/Engine.exe

# IMPORTANT NOTES
The game engine runs as a pause state and there will be no running entities shown on the viewport. To run, simply click on "Play" on the top panel. "Stop" button deletes all entities on the viewport.
To exit out of fullscreen, press "-" button on keyboard OR Alt-Tab to close it.

# OTHERS
lib files contain all the library and other tools we used for the project.
Source codes only contain the codes that I have worked on. (feel free to ask for the entire repo with entire solution and full source code).
